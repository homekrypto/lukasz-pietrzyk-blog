# Voice Assistant Options

## Current Status
The voice assistant currently uses the Web Speech API (browser built-in), which has limited quality compared to services like ElevenLabs.

## Available Options

### 1. Remove Voice Assistant Entirely ‚úÖ FREE
- **Pros**: No quality issues, cleaner UI
- **Cons**: No voice interaction feature
- **Action**: Replace with original "Poznaj mojƒÖ ofertƒô" button

### 2. Keep Web Speech API (Current) ‚úÖ FREE
- **Pros**: Works offline, no API keys, no costs
- **Cons**: Limited voice quality, browser-dependent
- **Action**: Already implemented

### 3. Azure AI Speech üí∞ PAID (~$4/1M characters)
- **Pros**: High quality, low latency, supports Polish
- **Cons**: Requires API key, costs money
- **Setup**: Need Azure account and API key

### 4. OpenAI Text-to-Speech üí∞ PAID (~$15/1M characters)
- **Pros**: Good quality, low latency
- **Cons**: Requires API key, costs money, limited Polish support
- **Setup**: Need OpenAI API key

### 5. Coqui TTS (Open Source) ‚öôÔ∏è COMPLEX
- **Pros**: Free, good quality, supports Polish
- **Cons**: Requires Python backend, complex setup
- **Setup**: Need to set up Python server

## Recommendation

**For a professional business website, I recommend either:**
1. **Remove the voice assistant** - Keep the site clean and professional
2. **Use Azure AI Speech** - If you want high-quality voice interaction and don't mind the cost

**The current Web Speech API is not suitable for a professional business website due to quality issues.**

## Implementation

- A) Remove the voice assistant and restore the original CTA button
- B) Keep it as is (with Web Speech API)
- C) Set up Azure AI Speech (you'll need to provide API key)
- D) Set up another option

Let me know your choice!
